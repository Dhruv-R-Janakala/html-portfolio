  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I'm deeply passionate about technology and have recently launched my YouTube channel, "Dhruv's Innovatech," dedicated to exploring the latest in tech. Through this channel, I aim to share insights, review gadgets, and connect with fellow enthusiasts.</p>
  <p>I'm currently immersed in learning about artificial intelligence (AI), delving into AI algorithms, machine learning, and deep learning models. I'm fascinated by its endless possibilities and how it can revolutionize various industries. Additionally, I love participating in hackathons and coding leagues, constantly challenging myself and learning new skills in competitive coding competitions.</p>
  <p>My goal is to become a skilled Software Developer, adept at creating innovative solutions to real-world problems. I envision myself crafting efficient and user-friendly applications that enhance people's lives and experiences. Ultimately, I aspire to establish my own software development company, where I can lead a team in building cutting-edge software solutions.</p>
  <p>I completed my middle school ( VII - X ) at Airson English School, where I developed an interest in coding and excelled in Information Technology scoring A+. In high school ( XI - XII ) at B.K. Birla College, Kalyan, I honed my presentation skills and won the Logo competition for the college's commerce fest. I'm also secured an A+ in my Jr. College Computer Science result.</p>
